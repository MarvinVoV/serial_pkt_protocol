# Serial Pkt Protocol

This is a simple serial packet protocol for sending and receiving data over a serial connection. It uses a fixed-length
header to indicate the length of the packet, and a checksum to ensure the integrity of the data.
The protocol is designed to be simple and easy to implement, with minimal overhead. It is intended to be used in
embedded systems where memory is limited, and the goal is to minimize the number of bytes sent over the serial
connection.
